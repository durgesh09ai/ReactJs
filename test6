Welcome to the demo of EXL Proto Weave — an AI-powered solution designed to transform how research protocols are suggested.

To begin, click the plus icon to create a new research project. Then, click on the research title to enter the main research and experimentation interface.
We also maintain a Research History, so previous work can be revisited or reused later.

Let’s start this demo with a healthcare research topic.
Once submitted, the Planning Agent is activated.

This agent asks for some initial input to better understand your goals and context.
This "human-in-the-loop" step helps the AI generate more accurate and relevant outcomes.

Now, let’s provide those inputs.
Here, users can also narrow down the scope of the research or suggest specific directions.

Once all responses are filled, the user can approve the research plan.

Next, the Research Agent is launched.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the live progress of the research.

This agent works in the background, using multiple tools to search for papers, articles, and journals from trusted sources such as Europe PMC and PubMed.

It automatically identifies and selects the most relevant papers based on your topic.

The agent then analyzes each paper one by one.

This part — the Thinking Process — gives insight into how the agents and LLMs work together to coordinate the entire research flow.

Once the analysis is complete, a comprehensive report is generated.

You can view this report on the left panel.

The report is neatly organized into sections like Introduction, Methodology, Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria, and more.

You can easily scroll and navigate to different sections as needed.

The report also highlights gaps in the current research and provides a well-defined conclusion.

Based on those gaps, the agent recommends new protocols.

These recommendations include:

The rationale

Protocol title

Primary and secondary objectives

Study design

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Data sources, collection methods, sample size, analysis methods, and more.

After reviewing the report, you have the option to export it for further edits or manual adjustments.

With the report ready, we move to the Databricks panel to continue the experiment process.

Here, the relevant input is auto-filled based on the generated report, and you can make manual changes if needed.

Once finalized, click the Start Experiment button to begin processing in Databricks.

As you’ve seen, EXL Proto Weave.AI goes beyond basic searches.
It conducts deep, structured research with AI agents tailored for the healthcare domain.
