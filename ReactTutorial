Store : place where all the state of the application are stored.
Reducers : It is an object  just like as Controller which controll the action of the application , it is pure function , Action like, Add, Delete, Update . It is an object which having Key: Value things, Each key act as Action
UseSelector  :  This is the hook which is use to communicate with the Store, It selectively ask the store that I need that infornmation.
UseDispatch : THis hook is basically use to update Spacific things in the Store along with the reducer
const App: React.FC = () => { ... } 

: React.FC
This is TypeScript type annotation. Here, React.FC stands for "React Function Component." By annotating App with React.FC, you're telling TypeScript that App is a functional component in React.

React.FC (or React.FunctionComponent) is a built-in type in React's type definitions that represents a functional component. It automatically includes type checking for children, default props, prop types, and return type.

Padding is used to create space inside an element, between the element's content and its border. 	
<style>
        .box {
            padding: 20px;
            background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;
            border: 1px solid #000;
        }
media queries to apply different padding based on the screen size 
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
            .box {
                padding: 10px; /* Smaller padding for smaller screens */
            }
        }
    </style>

The .box class initially has padding: 20px;.
When the viewport width is 600 pixels or less, the padding is reduced to 10px using a media query (@media (max-width: 600px)).


Margins in CSS are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
This margin creates space outside the div, separating it from other elements.
One common use of margin is to center an element horizontally. This can be done by setting the left and right margins to auto.

margin: 0 auto; sets the top and bottom margins to 0, and the left and right margins to auto, which centers the element horizontally within its parent.

The <Router> component is a fundamental part of client-side routing in React applications. 
It is provided by routing libraries like React Router and is used to define the routing configuration for your application.


 <Router>
            <div>

                <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
                    <Route path="/user-dashboard" element=<UserDashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />/>
                </Route>
                </Routes>
            </div>
        </Router>

e: React.FormEvent : React.FormEvent is used to type form-related event handlers in React components.
------------------------------------------------------------
The e.preventDefault() method is used to prevent the default behavior of an event in JavaScript. When used in a React application,
it stops the default action associated with an event from being executed.

createSlice() is a function provided by Redux Toolkit that simplifies the process of creating Redux slices. 
A "slice" refers to a portion of the Redux state and the logic for handling actions and reducers related to that portion of the state. 
createSlice() combines the functionality of createReducer and createAction into a single API,
making it easier to write and maintain Redux logic.

Key Features of createSlice()
State Definition: You define the initial state for the slice.
Reducers: You define a set of reducer functions that handle specific actions.
Action Creators: It automatically generates action creators based on the reducer functions.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation
Initial State: The initial state of the authentication slice is defined with role and errorMessage.
Reducers: The login, logout, and setError reducers are defined to handle state changes. login sets the role and clears any error message,
logout clears the role and error message, and setError sets an error message.
Actions: createSlice() automatically generates action creators for each reducer function. These actions can be dispatched to update the state.
Store Configuration: The slice reducer is added to the Redux store.
Component Usage: The React component uses useSelector to access the Redux state and useDispatch to dispatch actions. The form handles submission, 
checking credentials, and dispatching appropriate actions.
Using createSlice() from Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of managing Redux state by combining the reducer logic and action creators in a concise and
readable way.

package.json
 It contains metadata relevant to the project.It specifies the project dependencies and their respective versions or version ranges.
package-lock.json
It Locks down the full dependency tree to exact versions, ensuring consistent installations.
Ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed on every installation.
